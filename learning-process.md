# Learning Process

### What is the Feynman Technique?

Explain the complex concepts in simple terms to someone else or pretend it explaining them to someone else.

### What are the different ways to implement Feynman Technique in your learning process?

1. Explain difficult concepts to friends by writing them on paper in simple terms.
2. Visualize someone before me and explain concepts that are easy for everyone but difficult for me.
3. Take help from colleagues and make them explain difficult concepts so that we can understand better. 

### Paraphrase the "Learning How to Learn TED talk by Barbara Oakley" video in detail 

- The brain while thinking is in two modes, Focus mode and Diffuse mode. 
- In focus mode, we'll be thinking tightly with intense concentration and logical thinking. 
- In diffuse mode, we connect the new techniques with the old techniques we know.
- Turn away the attention from a problem or concept if stuck during focus mode and get relaxed into the diffuse mode for some time. Switch to focus mode again then a solution to that problem will come eventually.
- Examine yourself by taking mini-tests for many days after learning and recalling concepts before entering focus mode.

### What are some of the steps that you can take to improve your learning process?

1. Take breaks in between while learning complex concepts.
2. Practice problems after learning every concept for 2-3 days.
3. Recall concepts before getting focussed again.

### Key takeaways from the video "Learn Anything in 20 Hours"

Steps for rapid skill acquisition in 20 hours
1. Deconstruct the skill 
   - Look into the skill and break it down into smaller pieces. Decide the parts that help and practice them first. 
2. Learn enough to self-correct
   - Get 3 - 5 resources to learn just enough for self-correct as we practice. Mistakes can be better seen and rectified.
3. Remove practice barriers
   - Take away distractions such as television, the Internet...etc, and be focused while practicing.
4. Practice at least 20 hours
   - Work on that for at least 20 hours focussed without any distractions.
The major barrier to skill acquisition isn't intellectual...it's emotional.

### What are some of the steps that you can while approaching a new topic?

1. Break the topic into sub-topics and learn the major sub-topics which are important.
2. Stick to 3 - 5 resources and learn from them. Correct mistakes if any found while learning.
3. Stay away from Phones, television, and any distractions that block the learning path.
4. Learn till become good at that topic or spend a maximum of 20 quality study hours.
