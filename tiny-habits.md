### Key takeaways from the video in as much detail as possible
The universal formula for human behavior is Motivation, Ability and Prompt. Tiny habitual changes can make significant changes in long term. One pushup a day might not build muscle in a month but it builds the courage to try 5 pushups later every day. Three types of habit prompts remind you to do a habit.
1. External prompts such as phone notifications and alarms.
2. Internal prompts such as emotions and thoughts.
3. Action prompts which are the completion of one behavior remind to start the next behavior.
Tiny habits take less than 30 seconds. Motivation will be increased by tiny habits a day for the long term which as a result increases the success rate. Small might not be sexy. It is successful and sustainable.

## Book Summary of Atomic Habits
### Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes and outcomes?
The three layers of behavioral change from outside to inside are Outcomes, Processes and Identity. We've got outcomes on the outside concerned with changing results and then processes related to our habits and systems and finally our identity which is related to our beliefs. Most of us work from outcome to identity rather than identity to outcomes. The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of our identity.
